``I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science
keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of 
course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a 
while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if 
we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of 
these machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for 
stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in 
the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense 
of fun. Above all, I hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as 
if you're Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What 
you know about computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to 
successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think 
and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than 
when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.''
